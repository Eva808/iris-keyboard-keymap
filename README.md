## Iris rev 6 keymap, Corne-style with macros
- Layers backlight and/or underglow
- CapsLock button backlight
- Macros
- Russian layout + symbols
- Additional Miryoku style modifiers 

For the CapsLock backlight to work correctly, it must be on the master side.
Both halves must be flashed separately otherwise the LED related features will not work properly due to the QMK limitation.
