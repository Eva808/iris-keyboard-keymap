## A custom layout for the Iris keyboard, layers indicator, Corne-style with macros 
- Layers backlight and/or underglow
- CapsLock button backlight
- Tap dancing
- Macros
- Russian layout + symbols
- Additional home row modifiers (Miryoku style)

For the CapsLock backlight to work correctly, it must be on the master side.
Both halves must be flashed separately otherwise the LED related features will not work properly due to the QMK limitation.
